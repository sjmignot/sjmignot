### Hello 

I'm Samuel Mignot, a coder, data scientist & writer. I'm interested in the connection points between language, code, data, and art.

I'm currently working on a couple small ML projects, learning rust, creating data visualizations for text, [a collaborative artist book](https://arisebyanyotherna.me), and redesigning my website
